After Kill Bill vol 2 I told myself never again am I doing this Part 1 and then Part 2 not when it's the plan from the beginning nope.  Glad everyone that I watch/listen to is saying that the film is great &I absolutely agree that Greig Fraser is the best cinematographer in the business.  In my mind he's fighting with the great Wally Pfister for best cinematographer of the last 40 years w/ Nolan's new guy the only other one that is even in the conversation",

Also Chalomet is kind of annoying compared to Kyle MachLachlan.\nVaguely related, Edna Mode has to be based off of Linda Hunt, who played Shadout Mapes, and omg, I didn't know that Si√¢n Phillips was also Cassiopeia in Clash of the Titans, but it makes perfect sense now.",

It's so dumb, it's clearly only done because of the people who don't know anything about Dune and assumed it's a \"white saviour movie.\" If you wanted to have some Fremen doubt the Atreides and the Prophecy, to set up the next movie. That's fine. That's a change I can live with. But Chani? That's a terrible person for that role.\n\nOh... yeah, I will probably definitely be someone who will be very disappointed after seeing this movie (I hope not). Since even Jeremy's review he talks about all the people who were complaining and talking about the changes from the books. It's *SO uneccesary, the books are incredibly good and the first movie was pretty faithfully adapted from the first half of the book, what possesed these people to make Chani the protagnist and change the story ffs, can't we EVER have a good adaptation of something*\n\np.s. as a bald man I take offense at the Harkonens all being bald. I wish they kept proper easthetic for Feyd. But I also wish they kept the baron a pederast. It's just part of the story and a good way to demonstrate how depraved he is.",
