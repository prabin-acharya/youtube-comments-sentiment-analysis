I think his thought about the role of the government is right on.  No more deficit spending.  Term limits for the law makers.  Government should stay out of people's lives as much as possible.  There has never been a CEO of a major company being interviewed in this way where he can openly disclose his thought and the company's plans.  Why would she suggest that he should step down from his position?  He's doing a wonderful job for his company and mankind.  Biden is very jealous of him.  Biden wants to use the government's money to help Musk's competitors.  This is NOT right.",

The neural link thing will be great for future products. Tesla has made miniscule progress with robots. Competitors in the electric car market have  a lot to prove, but they've already proven to be FAR better at FSD. Musk's Achilles Heel is software development in general. I agree with him about the USA budget though even though I am not a member of the GOP. I agree that he is a genius business man and has a good sense of humor.",
