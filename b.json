After Kill Bill vol 2 I told myself never again am I doing this Part 1 and then Part 2 not when it's the plan from the beginning nope.  Glad everyone that I watch/listen to is saying that the film is great &I absolutely agree that Greig Fraser is the best cinematographer in the business.  In my mind he's fighting with the great Wally Pfister for best cinematographer of the last 40 years w/ Nolan's new guy the only other one that is even in the conversation",

    "text": "Having watched Dune Part 1, though the cinematography is sometimes nice in a very retro-futuristic way, like it would be cool in a series of stills in a coffee-table book, the whole movie is kind of dry and bland compared to the one from the 80's, which was stylish and vigorous by comparison. Also Chalomet is kind of annoying compared to Kyle MachLachlan.\nVaguely related, Edna Mode has to be based off of Linda Hunt, who played Shadout Mapes, and omg, I didn't know that Si√¢n Phillips was also Cassiopeia in Clash of the Titans, but it makes perfect sense now.",
